### Introduction
The Azure ReactJS CI Demo is a simple ReactJS application that demonstrates how to set up continuous integration pipelines with Azure DevOps. It includes a sample ReactJS application along with a configuration for building, testing, and deploying the application automatically.

### Features
Automated build and deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps
Configuration for linting and testing the ReactJS application
Sample ReactJS application to showcase the CI process

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Node.js (version >= 12) and npm installed locally
Azure DevOps account (https://dev.azure.com/) with appropriate permissions
Azure subscription for deploying the application
Docker (optional, if you plan to use containerized deployments)

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/Chiranjeevi521/azure-reactjs-ci-demo.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd azure-reactjs-ci-demo
```
Install the dependencies using npm:
```
npm install
```

### Usage
To start the development server locally, run the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application on http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

To run the tests, use the following command:
```
npm test
```

To create a production-ready build, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate an optimized and minified build in the build directory.

### Configuration
To configure the CI/CD pipelines for your project, follow these steps:

* Create an Azure DevOps project and configure your repository as a source.
* Set up the build pipeline to trigger on commits to the repository.
* Configure the build pipeline to install dependencies, run tests, and build the ReactJS application.
* Set up the release pipeline to deploy the built application to your target environment (e.g., Azure Web App, AKS, etc.).
* Customize the pipeline as per your requirements, such as adding additional steps or environment variables.
* For more detailed instructions, refer to the Azure Pipelines documentation.
